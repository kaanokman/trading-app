# Trading & Portfolio Analytics Single-Page Web App

This is a web application that mimics the functionality of a trading app. The application uses a multi-tiered system (React front-end, Python back-end, and an SQL database) and lets users log in, deposit money, make trades, view their balance, and view their portfolio all in one dashboard.
